# Laravel App Sample

This code is intended to demonstrate the complexity and level of detail I am accustomed to when working with Laravel.

These files are pulled from a much more robust proprietary Laravel app that was a Hub for users to store and manage multiple WordPress websites. Naturally, this code is not functional, and all references to the actual owner of the product have been removed (e.g., brand names, URLs, etc). A majority of this code was written (or modified) by me personally.

Most of these code samples are related to a feature that created backups of a WordPress website, as triggered from within the Hub. This process required a companion plugin to be installed on the user's WordPress site as well.

**Features at a glance**
- PHP 8+
- Use of Models, Controllers, and Routes
- Use of Events, Listeners, and Jobs
- Use of Enums, Policies, and Resources
- REST API Endpoint creation and handling of API Requests
- Codeception Testing
