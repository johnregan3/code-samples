# Simple Plugin

An intentionally simple code sample plugin.

This is merely intended to demonstrate the level of WP integration and development environment I am used to working with.

It is based on a product from a previous employer, so the code is not functional. For instance, it is intentionally missing a proprietary git submodule, and URLs/Endpoints have been mocked with placeholder names.

The best starting place is `code-sample-plugin.php`, from there you can trace the JS assets.

**Features worth noting**
- Use of tools/technologies like `composer`, `npm`, `webpack`, `phpcs`, etc.
- Code documentation & WP Coding Standards
- React integration
